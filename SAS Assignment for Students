* QUESTION 1 Merge datasets

A wildlife rescue center maintains a database consisting of two SAS data sets called FRIENDS and NEWINFO. 
The FRIENDS data set contains one observation for each supporter. Every time the center receives a donation, 
the staff add an observation to the NEWINFO data set. They also add an observation to NEWINFO every time there is
 a new volunteer or a change of address. To create an up-to-date data set of supporters, the staff need to combine 
the NEWINFO data set with the FRIENDS data set.;

* QUESTION 3 Specific PROC Use;

* Suppose that at a local university the study guidelines for the College of Science and Math are to study two to three 
hours per unit per week. The instructor of the class, Orientation to the Statistics Major, takes these guidelines very 
seriously. He asks students to record their study time each week, and at the end of the term he compares their average 
study time per week to their term GPA. The SAS data set called STUDY_GPA contains student identification information, 
orientation course-section number, number of units enrolled, average time studied, and term GPA.

* ANS A:;

	SET 'P:\SAS\A2\study_gpa.sas7bdat';

	TITLE 'TWO SECTION REGRESSION COMPARISON';
	KEYLEGEND /POSITION = RIGHT;
RUN;

* ANS E:;
* PLOT 1 (BOTH SECTIONS)- THE GPA VALUE IS RANDOM AND IS NOT DEPENDEDNT ON THE AVERAGE STUDY TIME IF 
THE DATA FOR BOTH SECTIONS ARE COMBINDED
* PLOT 2 (SECTION 1)- THE GPA VALUE DECREASES WITH THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE STUDY TIME FOR SECTION 1
* PLOT 3 (SECTION 2)- THE GPA VALUE INCREASES WITH THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE STUDY TIME FOR SECTION 2

* QUESTION 4. Specific PROC Use

* The local public transportation company would like to conduct a study of the impact of three possible plans on a certain 
popular bus route in town. Plan one consists of traffic lights timed in sync via a special remote transmitter on the bus that 
interacts with the traffic signal. Plan two consists of shutting down a regular traffic lane to become an express lane for 
buses only. Plan three is the current normal bus route with no changes. To assess the impact of a change, the company 
implemented plan one for a month, and then implemented plan two for a different month. All three plans were measured during 
summer months to ensure consistency in weather. The time (in minutes) for a bus to complete its route was measured for randomly 
selected weekdays and weekends, and these data are stored in the SAS data set called BUS.;

* ANS A;

DATA BUS;
	SET 'P:\SAS\A2\bus.sas7bdat';

PROC PRINT DATA = BUS LABEL;

PROC CONTENTS DATA= BUS;

	CLASS PLAN;
	MODEL TIME = PLAN; 
	MEANS PLAN / TUKEY;
	TITLE 'BUS PLANS TIME COMPARISON'; 
RUN;

* THE P-VALUE IS MUCH LOWER THAN ALPHA=0.05 AND HENCE WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT THE MEANS TRAVEL TIME BETWEEN THE 
DIFFERENT BUS ROUTE PLANS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT;

* ANS C:;

PROC TTEST DATA = TTBUS;
	WHERE PLAN IN ('Plan1','Plan2');
	CLASS PLAN;
	VAR TIME;
RUN;
PROC TTEST DATA = TTBUS;
	WHERE PLAN IN ('Plan1','Plan3');
	CLASS PLAN;
	VAR TIME;
RUN;
PROC TTEST DATA = TTBUS;
	WHERE PLAN IN ('Plan2','Plan3');
	CLASS PLAN;
	VAR TIME;
RUN;

* ANS D:;
* THE MEAN TIMES FOR THE 3 DIFFERENT BUS ROUTE PLANS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER.
THE MEAN TRAVEL TIME FOR PLAN 1 IS 20.3 MINUTES, PLAN 2 IS 28.7 AND PLAN 3 IS 30.5.

* THUS THE CURRENT PLAN IS THE WORST OPTION AND HAS THE HIGHEST TRAVEL TIME;

* THE CITY SHOULD ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT PLAN 1 WHICH WOULD CUT DOWN TRAVEL TIME BY OVER 33% FROM THE EXISTING PLAN;
